        A blog application is a web or mobile application with two sets of users: bloggers and readers. Bloggers use the app to create posts, edit posts, and submit posts for review by their editors. Readers use the app to view new posts on a particular blog as they are published, read individual blog posts, comment on those posts, and subscribe to receive notifications from blogs they follow. A blog app may also include a dashboard that enables administrators to set user permissions on specific blogs or on all blogs within the service.

Blogs are similar to other publishing apps that host text, images, audio, video, and other content. Examples of popular blogs include Medium, WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, and LinkedIn Pulse.
